# Security Policy

This package IS actively maintained even though it gets a low score
in the 'Maintained' field from OSSF-Scorecard. The reason is the lack
of activity. That's because this is a mature program that doesn't NEED
any modification. We could write a bot to simulate activity to satisfy the
algorithm, but why bother?
