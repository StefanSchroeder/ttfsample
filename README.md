# ttfsample

Creates a sample image of a Truetype TTF font or Opentype OTF font.

ttfsample will take a font file as an input and create a PNG-image 
with a sample of the font. 

For the License see LICENSE.

The program comes with a GNU Free Sans and Serif Bold True Type font which 
are under the GNU Free Font license.

	https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/license.html

There are a couple of options, primary being, that you can supply the text to be
printed as an argument. But there is also a sensible default (see image).

When run with the font Arial Narrow, the result will look like this:

![Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StefanSchroeder/ttfsample/master/sample/sample.png)

The name of the font will always be included, printed with a
boring font, GNU FreeSansBold, that is always
readable even if the font has only symbols.
