# ttfsample
Creates a sample image of a Truetype font

ttfsample will take a TTF-file as an input and create a PNG-image 
with a sample of the font. 

For the License see LICENSE.

The program comes with a GNU Free Sans Bold True Type font which 
is under GNU Free Font license.

https://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/license.html

Usage:

    go run *.go -fontfile <path-to-your-ttf-font>
    ./ttfsample.exe -fontfile <path-to-your-ttf-font> (Windows)
    ./ttfsample -fontfile <path-to-your-ttf-font> (Linux)

There are a couple of options, primary being, that you can supply the text to be
printed as an argument. But there is also a sensible default (see image).

When run with the font Arial Narrow, the result will look like this:

![Sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StefanSchroeder/ttfsample/master/sample/sample.png)

This will create an image file in the png/ directory which will 
created if it does not exist.

The name of the font will always be included printed with a
boring font, by default GNU FreeSansBold, that is always
readable even if the font has only symbols.
